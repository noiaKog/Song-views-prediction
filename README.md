# Song-views-prediction

This repository contains the code for training a machine learning model to predict the views of songs using a song dataset. The dataset was preprocessed and used to train a predictive model, allowing us to estimate the number of views a song is likely to receive.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is the "Spotify and Youtube" dataset, which can be accessed from the following link: [Spotify and Youtube Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salvatorerastelli/spotify-and-youtube). This dataset provides information about songs, including their metadata, artist details, and various audio features. It also includes the corresponding view counts for each song on YouTube. The dataset has been carefully cleaned and processed to ensure data quality.
